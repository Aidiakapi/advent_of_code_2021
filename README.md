# Advent of Code 2021

My solutions for Advent of Code 2021. Written in Rust ðŸ¦€.

- Clone the repository, make sure you don't have git's `autocrlf` (keep `\n`
  line endings).
- Make sure you have a nightly version of Rust (around December 2021).
- `cargo run --release` for all days, `cargo run --release -- XX` for a specific
  day.
- Want your own inputs?
    - **Auto-download:** Delete the `inputs` directory, then create a
      `session_key.txt` file containing your AoC website's session cookie value.
    - **Manually:** Replace the contents of a `inputs/XX.txt` file with your
      desired input. (Ensure that it has `\n` line endings.)
